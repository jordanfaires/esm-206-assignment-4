# Introduction 

California spiny lobster (**Panulirus interruptus**) is an econom

Due to their limited mobility and range, species such as the California spiny lobster are predicted to exhibit significant increases from the establishment of even a small MPA (Withy-Allen et al. 2013). Marine protected areas have positively impacted spiny lobster abundance and size in the Santa Barbara Channel Islands (Kay et al. 2012) Thus, the spiny lobster community abundance and size would be expected to increase after the establishment of similar MPAs in the Santa Barbara Channel. Here, we use data collected by SBC LTER to compare changes since 2012 in spiny lobster abundance and size in sites within MPAs and in sites outside of MPAs in the Santa Barbara Channel.

# Methods

Data for California spiny lobster (Panulirus interruptus) abundance, length and location from 2012 to 2018 was collected by [Santa Barbara Term Ecological Research (SBC LTER) ](https://sbclter.msi.ucsb.edu/). Data collection began in 2012 and is ongoing. Abundance and size data is collected annually by divers in late summer across five survey locations along the mainland coast of the Santa Barbara Channel. Two locations (Isla Vista and Naples) are located within Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), while three locations (Arroyo Quemado, Mohawk and Carpenteria) are not. Mean spiny lobster length (mm) for MPA and non-MPA survey locations in 2012 and 2018 were compared by two-sample t-tests ($\alpha$ = 0.05). Analyses and figures were prepared using R software version 3.6.1.

### Results A: Marine Protected Area Impacts on Lobster Abundance Over Time

The annual number of spiny lobsters observed at all sampling locations appears to have increased after the establishment of Marine Protected Areas. This sustainaed growth in abundance is especially pronounced for locations within MPAs (Isla Vista and Naples.)  The locations within MPAs were the only two locations to see an increase in the annual count of lobsters between 2017 and 2018.

### Results B: Marine Protected Area Impacts on Spiny Lobster Community Size Distributions

After MPAs were established in 2012, a noticeable increase in community size has appeared for sites located within MPAs (Isla Vista and Naples.) The growth in community size can be contrasted with the non-MPA community size, which appears to have stayed relatively constant after MPAs were established. While the community size at Arroyo Quemado and Carpenteria appear to have slightly increased between 2012 and 2018, the community size at Mohawk appears to have slightly decreased.

```

Mean spiny lobster lengths (mm) were compared for sites within Marine Protected Areas in 2012 (n = `r {nrow(lobster_mpa_2012)}`) shortly after the MPAs were established, and in 2018 (n = `r {nrow(lobster_mpa_2018)}`). Mean lengths were also compared for sites not within MPAs in 2012 (n = `r {nrow(lobster_non_mpa_2012)}`) and in 2018 (n = `r {nrow(lobster_non_mpa_2018)}`).

In 2012, the mean lobster size (mm) observed in MPA sites (`r round(t_test_2012_directional$estimate[1],2)`) is significantly less than mean lobster size for non-MPA (`r round(t_test_2012_directional$estimate[2],2)`) sites by a one-sided t-test (t(`r round(t_test_2012_directional$parameter,2)`) = `r round(t_test_2012_directional$statistic,2)`, *p* = `r round (t_test_2012_directional$p.value,2)`). The effect size by Cohen's *d* is medium (`r round(mpa_nonmpa_2012_d$estimate,2)`).

```{r}
# Question 2 - For 2018 observations, is there a significant difference in lobster size between MPA and non-MPA sites? 

t_test_2018_size <- t.test(lobster_mpa_2018$size_mm, lobster_non_mpa_2018$size_mm)

# One sided - is MPA 2018 greater than non-MPA 2018? 

t_test_2018_size_directional <- t.test(lobster_mpa_2018$size_mm,
                                       lobster_non_mpa_2018$size_mm,
                                       alternative = "greater")

# Yes - MPA 2018 greater than non-MPA 2018.

# Calculate effect size with Cohen's d

mpa_nonmpa_2018_d <- cohen.d(lobster_mpa_2018$size_mm,lobster_non_mpa_2018$size_mm)


# Effect size small (.35)

```

In 2018, the mean lobster size (mm) observed in MPA sites (`r round(t_test_2018_size_directional$estimate[1],2)`) is significantly greater than mean lobster size for non-MPA sites (`r round(t_test_2018_size_directional$estimate[2],2)`) by a one-sided t-test (t(`r round(t_test_2018_size_directional$parameter,2)`) = `r round(t_test_2018_size_directional$statistic,2)`, *p* = < 0.001). However, the effect size by Cohen's *d* is small (`r round(mpa_nonmpa_2018_d$estimate,2)`).

```{r}

# Question 3 - For MPA sites only, is there a significant mean size difference in lobsters observed in 2012 vs. 2018?

t_test_MPA_over_time <- t.test(lobster_mpa_2012$size_mm, lobster_mpa_2018$size_mm)

# One sided - is MPA 2012 less than MPA 2018? (i.e. is MPA 2018 greater than MPA 2012?)

t_test_mpa_time_directional <- t.test(lobster_mpa_2018$size_mm, 
                                      lobster_mpa_2012$size_mm, 
                                      alternative = "greater")

# Yes - MPA 2018 greater than MPA 2012. 

# Calculate effect size with Cohen's d

mpa_over_time_d <- cohen.d(lobster_mpa_2018$size_mm,lobster_mpa_2012$size_mm)

# Effect large (.87)
                                
```

Mean lobster length (mm) observed at MPA sites in 2012 (`r round(t_test_MPA_over_time$estimate[1],2)`) and 2018 (`r round(t_test_MPA_over_time$estimate[2],2)`) also differed significantly, with lobster size in MPA sites significantly greater in 2018 than in 2012 by a one-sided t-test (t(`r round(t_test_mpa_time_directional$parameter,2)`) = `r round(t_test_MPA_over_time$statistic,2)`, *p* = < 0.001). The effect size by Cohen's *d* is large (`r round(mpa_over_time_d$estimate,2)`).

```{r}

# Question 4 For non-MPA sites only, is there a significant mean size difference in lobsters observed in 2012 vs. 2018?

t_test_non_mpa_over_time <- t.test(lobster_non_mpa_2012$size_mm, lobster_non_mpa_2018$size_mm)

# No need for one sided here - not significantly different. 

```
However, mean lobster size (mm) observed at non-MPA sites in 2012 (`r round(t_test_non_mpa_over_time$estimate[1],2)`) and 2018 (`r round(t_test_non_mpa_over_time$estimate[2],2)`) is not significantly different (t(`r round(t_test_non_mpa_over_time$parameter,2)`) = `r round(t_test_non_mpa_over_time$statistic,2)`, *p* = `r round (t_test_non_mpa_over_time$p.value,2)`)

# Summary

- The abundance of California spiny lobsters has increased in the Santa Barbara Channel since the establishment of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) in 2012 (see Figure 2.) These population increases were especially pronounced at sites within a Marine Protected Area (Isla Vista and Naples) (see Table 1).
- Marine Protected Areas appear to have impacted the community size of spiny lobsters. Mean length of the lobsters observed at MPA sites increased by a statistically significant amount between 2012 and 2018 (see Table 1.)
- While the total abundance of lobsters observed at non-MPA sites increased between 2012 and 2018, there was no statistically significant difference in mean lobster length between 2012 and 2018.
